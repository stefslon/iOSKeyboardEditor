## iOS UCHR Keyboard Editor

I threw this together because I got fed up with the lame layout of Russian phonetic keyboard on iOS devices. If your device is jailbroken then you can replace any UCHR file located in /System/Library/KeyboardLayouts/USBKeyboardLayouts.bundle/uchrs This essentially changes external (bluetooth) keyboard layout.

This is written in MatLab, but I've included "deployed" EXE file that should run without MatLab.

Note: you CANNOT use this tool to change on-screen keyboard layouts.

Note 2: use this at your own risk and backup any UCHR files you modify.
